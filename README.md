# solar-system
Overview

This project is a simple solar system animation created using HTML and CSS. The animation demonstrates planets orbiting around a central sun using CSS animations and absolute positioning.


Features

Uses div elements and border-radius to create circular orbits.

Animates planetary orbits using CSS @keyframes.

Includes a background image (solar-system-img.jpg) to enhance the appearance.

Inner planets have faster rotation speeds, while outer planets move slower, mimicking real-life orbits.

Includes a moon orbiting around one of the planets.

Project Structure

index.html - The main HTML file containing the solar system structure.

style.css (embedded) - The CSS for designing the planetary orbits and animations.

solar-system-img.jpg - The background image representing space (not included, must be added separately).

How It Works

Each planet is represented by a div with a class .orbitX (where X is the planet number).

Orbits are created using nested div elements with different width, height, and border-radius.

CSS animations (@keyframes circle) rotate each planet around the sun.

A box shadow is used to give the sun a glowing effect.

How to Run

Download or copy the index.html file.

Place a suitable background image named solar-system-img.jpg in the same directory.

Open index.html in a web browser to see the animation.
